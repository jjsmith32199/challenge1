# Code Refactor Starter Code
# challenge1
The goal of this project was to make this webpage a more modern and accesbible experience while also making the code base more efficent and readable 
When refactoring the code for this webpage, there were a feW inital changes that stood out immediately and that I aimed to fix:
1. The lack of a title
2. The many undefined Div tags that could be more specific
3. The lack of alt tags for images
4. The reptitive nature of the css style sheet
